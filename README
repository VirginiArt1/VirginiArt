Generate a static html file from a direcotry with images (in ./static/img/).
The images are sorted in alfabetical order.
Each image goes with a description on ./p.txt each description goes in it's own line sorted like the images.
./index.html is the output (so we can see it in github pages).
The html and css is copied from bootstrap examples.
